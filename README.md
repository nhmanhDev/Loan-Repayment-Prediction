## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Prediction and performance metrics

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-repayment-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd loan-repayment-prediction
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data` folder.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to preprocess data, train models, and make predictions:
    ```bash
